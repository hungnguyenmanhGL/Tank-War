# Tank-War
A 2D top-down tank shooting game.
# Logic need tweaks:
- skillDurationEnded decides if player can use another skill. Mb change to allowAnotherSkill -> currentActiveSkill = null in SuperTankSkillController on activation.
- Change lv4 to a longer map: move from city to the main bridge. Move 6 towers to the side and add water around.
- Add multiple objectives in a level, move level finished logic to level controller.
- Add parabolic trajectory for mortar shell/grenade.
